## Download

You can download the latest version of the Wi-Fi Password Revealer from the [Download Link](https://github.com/vipinwap07/wifi-password-revealer/releases/download/v2/Wifi-Password-Revealer.exe).

## Usage

When running the application, some Windows users might encounter the "Windows protected your PC" message, which can be due to the executable not being recognized by Windows Defender SmartScreen. To bypass this message and proceed with running the application:

1. Click on "More info" on the "Windows protected your PC" window.
2. Then, click on "Run anyway" to start the application.

Once you've taken these steps, the application will run without any issues, and you can proceed to retrieve your saved Wi-Fi passwords.

Simply download and run the executable file. The application will list the saved Wi-Fi networks and their corresponding passwords on your Windows machine.
